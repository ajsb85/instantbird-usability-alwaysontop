#Always on Top
Keep Instantbird's buddy list always on top of other windows. 

###Features:
Always on Top is a neat extension that allows you to toggle the "Always on Top" status of the contact list from the Tools menu.
If it is set, then the contact list will always appear on top of all other windows on your desktop.

An options dialog, accessible from the addon manager dialog, allows to chose if the status should be remembered for the next Instantbird session (that is surviving restarts of the application).
